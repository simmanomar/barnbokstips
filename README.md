**Barnbokstips**

A previous group project during my web development course at **Kvinnofolkhögskolan March-April 2025**. 
We created a website where we would give tips on children's books. Each group member was responsible for creating
and styling a page showcasing books related to a specific age range. 

In this group project, I created the logo and was responsible for the page showcasing books for children aged 6-9.
